          In centaur chess – also known as cyborg or advanced chess – humans play in collaboration with an AI that generates a set of moves that the human chooses from. Since the 90s most humans play worse than most mid-level chess AI, but we can still beat the best supercomputers when playing as a human-AI pair.<sup><a href="#note1" class="ref">[1]</a></sup> <mark>What does a future of centaur design look like?</mark> Collaboration with AI is the near future, but what will the profession of graphic design look like in 15 years? <mark>Can we build an ethical future of design?</mark> One that is self critical in its relation to capital and works against inherent injustices of data violence.

        <h2><span>2.</span>The Future Is Now</h2>
        <p>
          Many free tools exist today that automate all aspects of design, from generating eSports logos and Instagram stories, to UI and page layouts.<sup><a href="#note2" class="ref">[2]</a></sup> Some researchers estimate that 45% of all activities people are paid to perform can be automated with existing technology.<sup><a href="#note3" class="ref">[3]</a></sup> Automated design tools are currently basically sophisticated templates, but generative adversarial networks (GANs) like pix2pix and styleGAN show that we are approaching some sort of machine learning (ML)<sup><a href="#note4" class="ref">[4]</a></sup> renaissance. The potential is vast: a conversational and frictionless interface that adapts to the user’s way of working,<sup><a href="#note5" class="ref">[5]</a></sup> and new alien strategies. The risks are equally as vast if these tools are built using data systems that reinforce injustices inflicted on vulnerable people,<sup><a href="#note6" class="ref">[6]</a></sup> and if there are no social services offered to people displaced by automation.<sup><a href="#note7" class="ref">[7]</a></sup> Equally important is the effect on the environment that the environmental damage due silicon mining necessary for this automation alone will inflict.<sup><a href="#note8" class="ref">[8]</a></sup> Here is the tangled web of the automation problem: <mark>labor, climate, surveillance, the absence of ethics in big tech and big data, and the possibilities of a post-work future</mark> – it cannot all be solved with graphic design obviously, but design is in a position to intervene.

          McKenzie Wark’s <i>Capital is Dead</i><sup><a href="#note9" class="ref">[9]</a></sup> posits a new class relation emerging from what others have called platform<sup><a href="#note10" class="ref">[10]</a></sup> or surveillance<sup><a href="#note11" class="ref">[11]</a></sup> capitalism: a hacker class and a vectoralist class. The hacker class spins up new information from nothing and is alienated from the value of their labor, while the vectoralist class controls the vectors through which this information flows.<sup><a href="#note12" class="ref">[12]</a></sup> Designers are positioned strangely within the hacker class because as Michael Rock writes in “Fuck Content,” design operates “in a modulating role between the user and the world.”<sup><a href="#note13" class="ref">[13]</a></sup> <mark>Suppose they gave a war and nobody designed for it?</mark>

          But of course, our collective power must be more than a refusal to work for unethical corporations or governments, as Erik Carter in “Do You Want Typography or Do You Want The Truth?” addresses, “graphic design has the ability to define our visual landscape, influence culture, and improve products for people but we need to address the issues of politics and prejudice in our profession and start combating them.”<sup><a href="#note14" class="ref">[14]</a></sup> <mark>We should look inward as a profession, and we are!</mark> But what is needed in addition is what David Rudnick discuses in his 2017 Strelka lecture:<sup><a href="#note15" class="ref">[15]</a></sup> new forms of ateliers that support one another<sup><a href="#note16" class="ref">[16]</a></sup> to find what design looks like in the proliferation of new tools and graphic design’s transition into four dimensions and mixed reality interfaces.<sup><a href="#note17" class="ref">[17]</a></sup>

        <h2><span>3.</span>Variable Brands</h2>
        <p>
          Variable fonts are typefaces that can be modified using different parameters. The brands of the future will be similarly variable. With minute data about a person’s mood and powerful prediction models, a brand could appear multiple ways to multiple different people. In 2019, Wired founding editor Kevin Kelly predicts that the next platform for big tech companies is a 1-to-1 data replica of the real world,<sup><a href="#note18" class="ref">[18]</a></sup> where each object is indexed and subject to speculative trading. Designs of the future will necessarily be automated because of the near infinite variations of graphics needed to market granularly to each specific consumer.

        <p>
          We all have a hand in the creation of this future because it is our data that’s building it. If we build more open-source tools for automating design, will we have a say in the ethics that accompany this future? <mark>Who is writing the code for our current systems and the systems of the future? What system of ethics are they including?</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to train a styleGAN model – the machine learning framework used to make the images accompanying this essay – is to use Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ),<sup><a href="#note19" class="ref">[19]</a></sup> a dataset of around 70,000 images of people’s faces pulled from the image-sharing platform flickr. The dataset alone is remarkable: did every one of these people knowingly consent to being included? And what of the thousands of hours of Amazon Mechanical Turk underpaid labor used to pre-process these thousands of images? <mark>There is no ethical creation of automated design tools under capitalism.</mark> We have to evolve our profession in tandem with what will replace it in the years to come.
        </p>
        <ul class="notes">
          <li id="note19">19. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948 ">“A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks”</a> from 2018, three researchers at NVidia released the FFHQ dataset available <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset">here</a>.</li>

        <p>
          The original goal of this project was to build a contemporary poster generator trained on thousands of images of posters by a small set of contemporary graphic designers. The results don’t look like posters at all. The images are swirling and amorphous, sometimes resolving into fabric-like molding grids or Barbara Hepworth-y organic glob patterns. StyleGAN doesn’t work well with sets of images that look wildly different from one another like the set of posters on which it was trained. <mark>To a person with an ML background these outputs are failures, but they are undoubtedly beautiful!</mark> What are the possibilities of further collaboration of this nature where the output is not predetermined by either person or machine but the result of the productive errors of both?

        Many of our digital platforms are built atop stray generosity.

Built collaboratively and in conversation, the ethics of these tools are worked out as it is built. What does design have to offer to evolving the interfaces of these community-built tools, making them even more usable and intuitive?

        <mark>When the output of an automated graphic design is indistinguishable from one made by a human, what is the value of the design made by a human?</mark> It is possible that this work will occupy the same space as an artisanal microbrew, valued for the number of unnecessary hours and human touch that went into making it.
        </p>
        <p>
        For educators the task is simple: teach your students to research and adapt. Research strategies will be important as ever as designers transition into managing systems of AI at higher levels. Research can lead to adaptability if students are encouraged to seek out new tools and processes and teach themselves, and adapting to new tools will be necessary as the job of the designer changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        In front-end web development there is a concept of “javascript fatigue:” when one is overwhelmed by the amount of new tools and processes to learn. It is up to all of us to combat this by preserving what excites us in our personal practice, engineering new projects around learning new skills, and bringing in our passions outside the profession to sustain us mentally and challenge us critically. <mark>It’s vital that we also practice skill-sharing and teach each other these emerging tools.</mark>

        <h2><span>6.</span>The Beautiful Move</h2>
        <p>
          In move 37 of the second game between Google DeepMind’s Go playing program AlphaGo vs. the world champion Lee Sedol, the computer made a move so unexpected that Lee left the tournament room in shock.<sup><a href="#note25" class="ref">[25]</a></sup> The commentators called it “inhuman” and “alien.” Go master Fan Hui, who played and lost against AlphaGo in an earlier tournament, remarked “It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move. So beautiful.”
        </p>
        <ul class="notes">
          <li id="note25">25. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNrXgpSEEIE">The specific moment is archived here on Youtube</a>. For more on AlphaGo, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y">the DeepMind-produced documentary</a> is a good deep-dive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <mark>What is a beautiful move in graphic design?</mark> Beauty, like the alien style of play of AlphaGo, is emergent from the various parts (typographic rules, gestalt principles, color theory, strategic rule-breaking, etc.) that make up the whole of a design.
        </p>
        <p>
          AlphaGo used a foundation of the game to make a new style — it played against itself until it learned to beat the best humans in the world. It’s “alien” strategy was an emergent style of play from it’s self-teaching process.<sup><a href="#note26" class="ref">[26]</a></sup> According to Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, Lee Sedol has begun learning from AlphaGo. So too will designers learn from the new ways of making that AI afford us, and surely in tandem we will build new forms of expression that no human alone could dream.
